A code base to determine 5 sorting algorithms only given the ability to call the functios of the 5 algos. 

To solve this, I used time complexity analysis with varying size datasets, from 100k to 1m, integer arrays. 

After plotting the results, I was able to determine which algos were in O(n^2) and O(n*log(n)) time complexity. 

To distinguish the algos within the O(n^2) and O(n*log(n)) groups, I had to use arrays that were known to generate the worst case runtimes for the specific algos.
